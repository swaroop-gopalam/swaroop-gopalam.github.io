**Abstract:** This paper analyses the data message success rate for Internet of Things (IoT) sensing devices communicating over Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite links. We present an analytical framework for optimizing multi-objective multi-packet reception on the uplink. We present an analytical result for the probability of message success for a given ground terminal, and present an analytical result for the overall probability of message success, averaged across all terminals.
