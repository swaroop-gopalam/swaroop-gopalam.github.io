About Me
----
I am an early career researcher working as a postdoctoral research fellow at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. My current research focus is on 1) Delay-Doppler domain waveform design for 6G, 2) LEO Satellite communications and 3) Optimization of mmWave cellular networks. I have previously worked on various wireless modelling and optimization problems including 1) UAV channel modelling, UAV communication optimization, 2) Resource allocation and control algorithms for future 5G wireless networks, including mmWave networks, Hetergeneous Networks, ad-hoc networks and Aerial Networks. My PhD thesis, under the supervision of Prof. Stephen Hanly and Prof. Philip Whiting, was focused on application of stochastic processes for modelling wireless communication systems, and using convex optimization and queuing theory to develop low-complexity control and resource allocation algorithms.

Biography

I received the B.Tech. degree in Electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in 2014. I received the M.Res. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering from Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, in 2017 and 2021 respectively. I have been working as a Research Fellow (in my current role) in the School of Engineering at Macquarie University since 2021.
